# Spotify for sys-tune
Allows you to play songs directly from Spotify using sys-tune. Start songs/playlists in the "Spotify for sys-tune" homebrew app, and have them keep playing outside of the app with sys-tune. After launching the app once, you will also be able to access Spotify songs inside of the sys-tune overlay.

## Installation
It is highly recommended that you download sys-tune (https://github.com/HookedBehemoth/sys-tune) before installing this for additional features such as playback outside of the app. Once you have installed sys-tune, install Spotify for sys-tune by going to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/az2541/Spotify-for-sys-tune/releases), downloading the latest release, and placing it on your SD card as `/switch/Spotify-for-sys-tune.nro`. Once you have downloaded Spotify for sys-tune and placed it on your SD card, please open it to finalize setup and add Spotify options to sys-tune.

## Support
If you encounter any issues using Spotify for sys-tune, please [file an issue](https://github.com/az2541/Spotify-for-sys-tune/issues) and I will get back to you shortly.

## Building
Build the same way you build sys-tune (see https://github.com/HookedBehemoth/sys-tune for more information about that).
